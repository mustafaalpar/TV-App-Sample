# TV-App-Sample

Description

This repository contains an unfinished TV app sample developed during my summer 2023 internship at X Akademi (formerly known as EÄŸitim Kutusu). The project aimed to create a functional TV application as part of my learning and development experience.

Project Context

During the internship, I worked independently on this project, facing constraints such as limited time and resources. Despite these challenges, I managed to make significant progress on my own.

Note

This project is archived and is not intended for further development. It serves as a demonstration of my work and learning during the internship.
